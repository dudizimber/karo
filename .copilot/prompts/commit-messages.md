## Example Usage
```
**Files modified:**
- api/v1alpha1/alertreaction_types.go: Added Priority field to AlertReactionSpec
- controllers/alertreaction_controller.go: Implemented priority-based alert processing
- controllers/alertreaction_controller_test.go: Added tests for priority handling

**Type of changes:**
- [x] New feature (feat)

**Scope:**
- [x] controller - Controller logic changes
- [x] api - CRD/API type changes

**What was changed:**
Added priority field to AlertReaction CRD and implemented priority-based processing in the controller where higher priority alerts (larger numbers) are processed before lower priority ones.

**Why it was changed:**
Users needed the ability to ensure critical alerts are processed immediately while less important alerts can wait in queue during high-load scenarios.

**Impact:**
This enables users to configure alert processing order based on business criticality, improving response times for critical issues.
